1. The favorite place of mine definitely has to be Nagarkot. It's a famous place in Neal from where you can see the sunset/sunrise. 
    It is especially famous for a sunrise view of the Mount Everest along with other mountains.

2. The other place has to be a place called Pokhara. Another famous tourist destination but it is also popular among us locals.
