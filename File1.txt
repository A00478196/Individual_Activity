1. The favorite place of mine definitely has to be Nagarkot. It's a famous place in Neal from where you can see the sunset/sunrise. 
    It is especially famous for a sunrise view of the Mount Everest along with other mountains. I like it the best
    when it is raining. You can't quite see the mountains during the rain but it is absolutely majestic.


2. The other place has to be a place called Pokhara. Another famous tourist destination but it is also popular among us locals.
    I cannot just name one place in Pokhara because there are so many, but the "Fewa Lake" is gorgeous espcially when
    it's raining and you're on a boat. It's a beautiful place.
